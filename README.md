# Merge when green

Tired of waiting for long-running tests before merging pull requests?

## Installation instructions

Visit https://github.com/marketplace/merge-when-green

### Configuration

Github has two different types of CI runs, "Checks" and "Statuses". Both run against PRs except Checks result in a 
"Checks" tab being available on the PR to give more information, while a Status is just a green tick (or red cross).
See [this GitHub article](https://help.github.com/en/articles/about-status-checks) for more information.

Merge when green supports both Checks and Statuses. You can configure which ones must pass for the PR to be considered
"green" in order for it to be merged. Create a `.github/merge-when-green.yml` file to list the require checks/statuses:

```yaml
requiredChecks:
  - circleci
  - travis-ci
requiredStatuses:
  - jenkins
```

By default, Merge when green will only require the `cicleci` and `travis-ci` checks.

#### Travis CI and CicleCI

To work with Travis CI and CicleCI make sure GitHub Checks are enabled.
